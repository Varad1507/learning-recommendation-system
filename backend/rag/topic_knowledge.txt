Topic: Sorting
Sorting algorithms arrange data in a specific order such as ascending or descending.
A strong understanding of sorting is essential because many advanced algorithms rely on sorted data.
Common student mistakes include misunderstanding time complexity, confusing stable and unstable sorting, and improper implementation of divide-and-conquer logic.
Students with low sorting scores often struggle with algorithm efficiency and optimization problems.
Best learning approach: begin with simple algorithms like Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort to understand comparisons and swaps, then progress to Merge Sort and Quick Sort to learn recursion and efficiency trade-offs.

Topic: Linked Lists
Linked Lists store data as nodes connected through pointers rather than contiguous memory locations.
Students often face difficulty with pointer manipulation, traversal logic, and handling edge cases such as insertion or deletion at the head or tail.
Linked Lists are fundamental for understanding stacks, queues, hash tables, and graph representations.
Weak performance in this topic usually indicates gaps in memory management and reference handling.
Best learning approach: practice implementing singly and doubly linked lists, focusing on insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

Topic: Arrays
Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations and allow constant-time indexed access.
Students commonly struggle with boundary conditions, index out-of-range errors, and inefficient looping logic.
Arrays form the basis for many data structures and algorithms including searching, sorting, and dynamic programming.
Low scores in arrays often indicate weak problem decomposition and iteration logic.
Best learning approach: practice basic array operations, sliding window techniques, and frequency-based problems.

Topic: Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.
Students frequently struggle with defining correct base cases and understanding call stack behavior.
Recursion is critical for tree traversal, divide-and-conquer algorithms, and dynamic programming.
Weak performance in recursion usually reflects difficulty in breaking problems into smaller logical units.
Best learning approach: start with simple recursive problems such as factorials and Fibonacci, then move to tree and graph-based recursion.

Topic: Searching
Searching algorithms locate elements within a data structure.
Students often misuse linear search where binary search could be applied, or incorrectly implement binary search logic.
Searching is fundamental for efficient data retrieval and optimization.
Low performance suggests difficulty in understanding sorted vs unsorted data handling.
Best learning approach: practice linear search first, then focus on binary search with careful attention to mid-point calculation and boundaries.

Topic: Basics
Programming basics include variables, loops, conditionals, and input-output handling.
Weak fundamentals often lead to poor performance across all advanced topics.
Students struggling here typically face issues with logical flow and syntax understanding.
Basics are critical for all programming and algorithmic problem-solving.
Best learning approach: focus on writing small programs, understanding control flow, and debugging simple logic errors.
